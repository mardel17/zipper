            rules. The Sponsor's point-of-sale clerk will tell you what (if anything) you have won and will then pay to you in cash anything that you have won. If instead you want to

            entry points and time on the computer work station spent revealing their award values will not reduce the telephone talk time that you have purchased. If you have purchased computer work station time,
            the use of promotional game entry points and time on the computer work station spent revealing their values will not reduce the time available to use the computer work station. If you have purchased music

            Whether you have entered for free or by purchase, you can not use promotional Winningss to play or replay the promotional game. Cash promotional awards and other promotional awards are offered at the rate
            of one cent per award credit that you receive. To collect at any time, tell the participating retailer what you have won. On verification of that amount the participating retailer will pay to you in
            currency, stored value cards or store merchandise, having a value in each case of the amount that you have won. The right to receive promotional Winningss cannot be assigned or transferred by the
            participant who is entitled to the Winningss.
